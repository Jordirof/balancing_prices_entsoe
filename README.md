# balancing_prices_entsoe
This repository contains balancing prices and day ahead prices of several European countries queried from ENTSOE.
The data is cleaned and explore using Python in a Jupyter notebook.
It is shown that day ahead prices are not helpful to predict balancing prices in the case of Austria.
